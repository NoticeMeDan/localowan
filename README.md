## How to run
Start by running the bootstrap script: `./bootstrap.sh`  
This initialises the database and the TTN stack, and creates an admin user for you.
Enter your admin user's password when prompted.  

When this is done, simply run `docker-compose up`, and access the stack at [https://localhost](https://localhost).
